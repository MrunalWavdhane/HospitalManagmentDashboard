# HospitalManagmentDashboard

Introduction

In this changing environment of healthcare, such hospitals like MKND Hospitals are going to face this dual challenge of providing excellent patient care, along with being sustainable from a financial point of view. Escalating patient needs necessitate the balancing of healthcare delivery along with financial oversight. Certain departments like the Emergency Department (ED), Inpatient Care, Surgical Services, and Finance face unique challenges: Overcrowding in ED, bed management in Inpatient Care, optimal surgical schedules in Surgical Services, and cost containment and revenue management amidst changing healthcare policies. To address these challenges, MKND Hospitals will be using data analytics to transform its operations. The initiative aims at the integration of KPIs and data visualization dashboards in order to enable increased efficiencies, satisfaction of the patients, and overall financial health. This type of approach aims to tackle patient flow and issues related to managing finances within the hospital so as to improve the healthcare management system and outcomes of patients. The selected KPIs will therefore attend to the critical aspects of the patient flow, care quality, resource efficiency, and financial stability. For instance, the ED could better its triage and care models by deploying analysis on wait times and throughputs, whereas the Finance Department could enhance performance through profitability analysis and budget management.

Using the questions and KPIs from the earlier report we formulate the following dashboard mockup:

1) Emergency Department 
1.	Average daily wait time (from arrival to initial assessment) = Total wait time for all patients / Number of patients assessed in that day
2.	Patient throughput (number of patients seen per hour) = The total number of patients / The total operational hours
3.	Rate of readmission for discharged patients (number of patients readmitted within a month) = Number of patients readmitted within 30 days / Total number of discharges in 30 days
4.	Patient satisfaction scores (satisfaction scores generated each month) = Total satisfaction score points / Number of surveyed patients

To do this we will calculate each of the four KPIs as follows:

KPIs Emergency Department:
1. Average Daily Wait Time:
Average Daily Wait Time = 
AVERAGEX(
    ED_Visits,
    DATEDIFF([ArrivalTime], [TriageTime], HOUR)
)
2. Patient Throughput:
Patient Throughput = 
COUNTROWS(ED_Visits) / (COUNTROWS(ED_Visits) / COUNTROWS(DISTINCT(ED_Visits[ArrivalTime])))

3. Rate of Readmission for Discharged Patients:
Rate of Readmission = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Inpatient_Admissions, DATEDIFF([AdmissionDate], [DischargeDate], DAY) <= 30)),
    COUNTROWS(Inpatient_Admissions)
)

4. Patient Satisfaction Scores:
Patient Satisfaction Scores = 
AVERAGEX(
    ED_Visits,
    [SatisfactionScore]
)

FILTERS USED: 
The "Filter of Month" feature in a Power BI-created hospital dashboard lets users choose a month or range of months to examine data over a given period of time. With the help of this filter, users may compare data across several months or examine hospital performance, patient patterns, or resource utilisation for a certain month.

The "Reason for Visit" filter classifies patient visits according to the main reason they went to the doctor. Users may divide and examine hospital data according to various patient visitation reasons, including regular check-ups, urgent care, operations, certain medical issues, etc. Healthcare administrators and professionals may use this filter to better understand how patient visits are distributed across different categories and to make choices about how best to allocate resources and enhance service delivery within the hospital.

2) Surgical Resource Management:

 
1.	Number of surgeries performed (by type) = Total number of each type of surgery performed
2.	Surgical cancellation rate = (Number of cancelled surgeries / Total number of scheduled surgeries) * 100
3.	Post-operative complication rates = (Number of patients with post-operative complications / Total number of surgical patients) * 100
4.	Utilization rate of operating rooms = (Total hours in use / Available operating hours) * 100

KPIs for Surgical Resource Management:

1. Number of Surgeries Performed (by Type):
Number of Surgeries = 
COUNTROWS(Surgeries)

2. Surgical Cancellation Rate:
Surgical Cancellation Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Surgeries, [Outcome] = "Cancelled")),
    COUNTROWS(Surgeries)
) * 100

3. Post-operative Complication Rates:
Post-operative Complication Rates = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Surgeries, [Outcome] = "Complications")),
    COUNTROWS(Surgeries)
) * 100

4. Utilization Rate of Operating Rooms:
Utilization Rate of Operating Rooms = 
DIVIDE(
    SUMX(Surgeries, DATEDIFF([StartTime], [EndTime], HOUR)),
    [Total Available Operating Hours]
) * 100




FILTERS USED:
The "Surgery Month" filter in a Power BI hospital dashboard lets users choose a month or range of months to examine surgical data for. With the use of this filter, users may narrow down their study to surgeries that were completed within a certain time range, which makes it easier to see trends, patterns, and performance indicators for those procedures.  

Users may filter surgical data according to various surgical outcomes or results by using the "Outcome" filter. This might involve results like a high risk of death, readmissions, complications, or successful surgery. Users may evaluate the success of surgical operations, pinpoint regions in need of development, and track patient results over time by choosing certain outcomes.
 

3) Inpatient Admissions:

1.	Average length of stay = Total days stayed by all patients discharged / Number of discharged patients
2.	Bed occupancy rate = (Average daily number of beds occupied / Total number of available beds) * 100
3.	Hospital-acquired infections rate = (Number of hospital-acquired infections / Total number of patient days) * 1000
4.	Patient recovery rate (discharge status) = Number of patients discharged with improved condition / Total number of discharges
KPIs for Patient Care Protocols:
1. Average Length of Stay:
Average Length of Stay = 
AVERAGEX(
    Inpatient_Admissions,
    DATEDIFF([AdmissionDate], [DischargeDate], DAY)
)

2. Bed Occupancy Rate:
Bed Occupancy Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(Inpatient_Admissions),
    [Total Available Beds]
) * 100

3. Hospital-acquired Infections Rate:
Hospital-acquired Infections Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Inpatient_Admissions, [Outcome] = "Hospital-acquired Infection")),
    SUMX(Inpatient_Admissions, DATEDIFF([AdmissionDate], [DischargeDate], DAY))
) * 1000
4. Patient Recovery Rate:
Patient Recovery Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(FILTER(Inpatient_Admissions, [Outcome] = "Improved")),
    COUNTROWS(Inpatient_Admissions)
)
FILTERS USED: 
The "Diagnosis" filter in a Power BI hospital dashboard lets users focus on particular diagnoses or medical problems to limit the data that is shown. From a dropdown list or search bar, users may choose one or more illnesses, filtering the dashboard to only display information relevant to the diagnosis they have chosen.

In a similar way, users may refine the data according to the month in which patients were admitted to the hospital by using the "Admission Month" filter. By choosing one or more months from a calendar interface or dropdown list, users can limit the dashboard's information presentation to only the specified admission months.

These filters provide users the freedom to concentrate on certain illnesses or admission times, allowing them to examine pertinent data and determine regarding operations, patient care and resource allocation.

4) Financial Transactions:
 

1.	Revenue vs. Expenses (profitability analysis) = Total Revenue - Total Expenses
2.	Departmental budget adherence = (Actual spending / Budgeted spending) * 100
3.	Average cost per patient visit = Total costs / Total number of patient visits
4.	Payer mix analysis (Medicare, Medicaid, Private Insurance, Out-of-pocket) = (Revenue from [Medicare/Medicaid/Private Insurance/Out-of-pocket] / Total Revenue) * 100

KPIs Finance Department:
1. Revenue vs. Expenses (Profitability Analysis):
Revenue vs. Expenses = 
SUM(Financial_Transactions[Amount]) - SUMX(Financial_Transactions, IF([Type] = "Expense", [Amount], 0))
2. Departmental Budget Adherence:
Departmental Budget Adherence = 
DIVIDE(
    SUMX(Financial_Transactions, IF([Type] = "Expense", [Amount], 0)),
    SUMX(Financial_Transactions, IF([Type] = "Budget", [Amount], 0))
) * 100

3. Average Cost per Patient Visit:
Average Cost per Patient Visit = 
DIVIDE(
    SUM(Financial_Transactions[Amount]),
    COUNTROWS(ED_Visits)
)

4. Payer Mix Analysis:
Payer Mix Analysis (Medicare) = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(SUM(Financial_Transactions[Amount]), FILTER(Financial_Transactions, [Category] = "Medicare")),
    SUMX(Financial_Transactions, [Amount])
) * 100
Payer Mix Analysis (Medicaid) = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(SUM(Financial_Transactions[Amount]), FILTER(Financial_Transactions, [Category] = "Medicaid")),
    SUMX(Financial_Transactions, [Amount])
) * 100
Payer Mix Analysis (Private Insurance) = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(SUM(Financial_Transactions[Amount]), FILTER(Financial_Transactions, [Category] = "Private Insurance")),
    SUMX(Financial_Transactions, [Amount])
) * 100
Payer Mix Analysis (Out-of-pocket) = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(SUM(Financial_Transactions[Amount]), FILTER(Financial_Transactions, [Category] = "Out-of-pocket")),
    SUMX(Financial_Transactions, [Amount])
) * 100

FILTERS USED:
The "Filter of Category, Surgery Month" in the finance section of a Power BI hospital dashboard probably enables users to filter and examine financial information about surgeries carried out within particular time frames.

- **Category Filter**: This filter lets users pick particular surgical procedure categories or kinds. Users can choose to filter by categories like general surgery, neurosurgery, orthopaedic surgery, etc. This makes it possible to analyse certain surgery kinds in-depth using financial data.

The **Surgery Month Filter** allows users to choose the time frame in which they would like to examine surgical finances. Viewers can choose a month or a range of months to see the financial information for procedures that were done in that period.

Users in the finance department may optimise financial management within the hospital and make well-informed decisions by combining these filters to obtain insights into the financial performance of various surgery kinds over specified time periods.


Data Source
	When embarking on a project with "Healtheon Hospitals," given that it's a fictional entity, we will be using simulated data. Simulated data allows us to model complex systems and generate data that represents a wide variety of scenarios that our hospital network might encounter. This approach is particularly useful for testing hypotheses, performing what-if analyses, and training staff without the risks and privacy concerns associated with using actual patient data.

Data Relationships
1.	PatientID is a foreign key in the Visits, ED Readmissions, Surgeries, and Financial Transactions tables, linking each visit, readmission, surgery, and transaction (where applicable) to a specific patient.
2.	VisitID links the ED Readmissions table to the Visits table, allowing us to track initial visits and subsequent readmissions.
3.	The Surgeries table will be linked to both the Visits and Financial Transactions tables to track surgical procedures and their financial implications.

Data Generation Strategy
1.	Randomization: Attributes such as arrival times, lengths of stay, and financial amounts will be randomly generated within realistic ranges based on typical hospital scenarios.
2.	Rules-Based Simulation: Certain data points will be created based on rules that reflect real-world scenarios, such as higher readmission rates for certain conditions.
3.	Variability: We will introduce variability in the data to simulate different patient outcomes, departmental efficiencies, and financial performances.
4.	Scalability: The model will be scalable to simulate data for different sizes of hospital networks, from a single hospital to a large network.

Utilization of the Model
This data model will provide the foundation for creating dashboards in BI tools, such as Power BI. We will be able to simulate and visualize KPIs for performance monitoring, such as average wait times, patient throughput, bed occupancy rates, and financial health, allowing stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions. The simulated data will be valuable for training purposes, system testing, and policy development within the MKND Hospitals network. It will allow us to explore various scenarios and their outcomes without risk to real patients or interference with actual hospital operations.
Update Plan
	The MKND Hospitals data analytics initiative's dashboard update process should be strategically planned to keep it current and effective. The following are strategies and considerations on how to update the dashboard in an effective manner, considering the need for automation, manual intervention, and potential challenges:

Update Frequency
•	Patient Care and Operational Metrics: Given that patient flow and hospital operations are dynamic, such dashboards should be updated in real-time or at least daily to reflect the most current data. This would include the performance of the emergency room (ED) wait times, patient admissions, and discharges, as well as operating room utilization.
•	Financial Metrics: Financial data, which would include analysis of costs, metrics of the revenue cycle, and adherence to budgets, can be updated less frequently—perhaps monthly or quarterly—to match the cycles of financial reporting.

Data Ingestion
•	Automated Data Feeds: To the extent possible, automate the process of data ingestion from electronic health records (EHRs), financial systems, and other hospital management software into the analytics platform. One can get this done through APIs or direct database connections.
•	Manual Inputs: Certain data, especially in newer metrics or departments where data is not in a digital record-keeping mode, may demand manual input. Have a plan for a smooth streamlined process on how updates should be done, along with validation steps to maintain the accuracy factor.

Automation Strategies
•	ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Processes: The ETL processes able to automate data extraction from several sources and transform it into consistent format and then load it into the database of the dashboard. This will help reduce the manual load and improve reliability.
•	Scheduled Updates: Update metrics that do not demand real-time data during the non-peak hours for minimizing the impact on the system's performance.

Potential Pitfalls and Strategies
•	Data Quality Problems: Inconsistent or inaccurate data will undermine the quality of the dashboard. Stipulate data validation and cleansing steps in the ETL processes. Regular audits can help with the identification of and mitigation against systemic data issues.
•	Integration of Systems: Inter-system data integration can be complicated. In that case, priority should be placed on building strong interfaces and mapping data structures effectively to ensure flawless data flow.
•	User Adoption: A dashboard is only useful if it is used. Design with usability in mind, keeping the relevance factor to the end-user. Follow with adequate training and continued support so that the adoption of the dashboard is a comfortable one.
•	Scalability: In case MKND Hospitals grows, or some other organizational or departmental changes are necessary, the ease of scalability must be done to handle growing data volumes and rising user loads.
•	Regular Reviews: Regularly review the effectiveness of the dashboard to the stakeholders so that they can confirm that the dashboard continues to meet their requirements in terms of departmental and organizational needs. This may result in the introduction of new metrics or the retirement of less useful ones.
•	Feedback Loops: Set up a feedback mechanism to allow the users to be reporting issues or suggesting improvements. The idea is to iteratively better this information tool.
